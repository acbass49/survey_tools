# survey_tools

This is a simple python package for survey research analysis containing convenient functions for crosstabs, recoding, and creating confidence intervals.

# Assorted Python Functions for Survey Research

1. Tabs Function - 1, 2, and 3 way tabs. Make them weighted or unweighted. Have them include NAs or not. Have them be counts or normalized by row, column, or cell.
2. Recoding Levels Function (Similar to car::recode in R) - Select a variable and create a simple recoding string to easily recode variables.
3. Get names function - Use regex to easily select names in a pandas.DataFrame
4. Get confidence intervals - Returns a dataframe of a count with lower and upper bound confidence intervals.

# Future Add-ons
1. Weighting function
2. Add CI function
3. Stacking survey
